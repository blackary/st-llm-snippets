# st-llm-snippets

Getting started snippets for Streamlit + LLMs. 3 use cases:

- A simple chatbot using OpenAI and streamlit-chat
- Upload a (txt) file and ask questions about it using Anthropic Claude
- Ask questions of an LLM that can search the web using LangChain + Serper + OpenAI

Each snippet requires one or more top level API Key secrets be configured in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
You can see the needed keys in the snippet code.
